		<p>My favorite CMSC subject is CMSC 170, because you get to know the basics of artificial intelligence.</p><br>
		<p>NASC 7 is my favorite GE because I love animals and the subject teaches us about their role in our environment.</p><br>
		<p>I like Python the best, because of how easy it is to use when coding.</p><br>
		<p>My favorite food is the Tapsilog from Tapa P's *chef's kiss*</p><br>
		<p>My hobbies include drawing animals and listening to music.</p><br>
		<p>My childhood dream is to become a pilot.</p>
